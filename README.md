# Dev Template Hub
A collection of useful development templates that I use in my projects — and share to help others save time.  
These templates cover different areas of software development such as configs, workflows, and boilerplates.

---

## What's Inside

- **Config Templates** – Ready-to-use configs for tools like Docker, Ansible, Terraform, etc.
- **GitHub Workflows** – CI/CD automation examples.
<!-- - **Project Starters** – Boilerplate code for quick project setup. -->
<!-- - **️Miscellaneous Utilities** – Helpful snippets and scripts. -->

---

## Why This Repo?

Instead of rewriting common setups over and over, I keep them here so I (and hopefully others) can quickly grab and use them.  
Think of this repo as a **developer’s toolbox** 🧰.
